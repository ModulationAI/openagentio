## Overview

OpenAgentIO is a lightweight, ACP-compatible communication runtime for AI agents. The roadmap is organized into six layers, each with incremental milestones. Breaking changes are batched into major version boundaries; minor versions focus on additive features and stability.

| Version | Theme | Timeline |
|---------|-------|----------|
| v0.2 (current) | Stabilize Go SDK, HTTP/SSE adapter, middleware chain | Now |
| v0.3 | Reliability, protocol state cleanup, first multi-language SDK | Q3 2026 |
| v0.4 | Advanced orchestration scenes, control plane foundation | Q4 2026 |
| v1.0 | Production-grade control plane, enterprise features | 2027 |

## 1. Protocol Layer: Align with A2A Philosophy

Goal: Gradually absorb A2A (Agent-to-Agent) design principles without premature lock-in to a moving standard. EventType semantic overload is the primary technical debt.

### v0.3 — Phase Field Introduction
- Add `Phase string` to `Envelope` (schema v2) to carry protocol state (`submitted` / `working` / `completed` / `failed`).
- EventType reverts to pure business routing key semantics.
- Dual-write transition: framework populates both `Phase` and `EventType`; consumers read `Phase` first, fallback to `EventType`.
- Update `IsTerminal()`, HTTP adapter error branching, and SSE event names.
- **Reference**: `prompts/a2a_prot.md` for detailed trade-off analysis (Options A/B/C).

### v0.4 — Task Model Evaluation
- Evaluate introducing a separate `Task` / `TaskUpdate` structure for Invoke/Stream paths, decoupled from the generic `Envelope`.
- `StreamInvoke` may return `TaskStream` instead of `Stream`.
- Decision gate: A2A ecosystem maturity + user demand for A2A interoperability.

### v1.0 — A2A Interoperability (Conditional)
- Full A2A protocol bridge if the standard stabilizes and gains traction.
- Native `TaskState` enum, OneOf-style response wrappers, artifact streaming.

## 2. Scene Layer: Richer Orchestration Patterns

Goal: Expand beyond basic Request-Reply, Streaming, and Pub/Sub to cover real-world multi-agent coordination patterns.

### v0.3 — Core Patterns
- **Parallel Execution**: Invoke multiple SubAgents concurrently, aggregate results (fan-out / fan-in).
- **Agent Handoff**: Transfer session context from one agent to another with explicit state passing.
- **Tool Calling**: Structured tool invocation with `ToolCall` / `ToolResult` event types (reserved in v0.2, enabled in v0.3).

### v0.4 — Advanced Patterns
- **Async Task with Callback**: Fire-and-forget task creation, completion notification via Pub/Sub or webhook.
- **Circuit Breaker / Degradation**: Middleware-level circuit breaker for cascading agent failures.
- **Multi-step Workflow**: DAG-style agent chaining with retry policies per edge.

### v1.0 — Enterprise Scenes
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Pause workflow for human approval, resume via API or event.
- **Multi-tenant Agent Marketplace**: Discovery and invocation of third-party agents across tenant boundaries.

## 3. SDK Layer: Multi-Language Support

Goal: Go remains the canonical reference implementation. Other languages follow after Go API freeze.

### v0.2 — Go SDK Stabilization (Current)
- Freeze `pkg/bus` public API.
- Complete golden sample tests as the cross-language specification baseline.
- Stabilize middleware interfaces (Recover, Trace, Logging, Retry, DeadLetter).

### v0.3 — Python SDK Restart
**Restart conditions** (all must be met):
1. Go v0.2 released with API freeze announcement.
2. Core golden sample tests pass stably for 2+ weeks.
3. `schema/envelope.schema.json` and `pkg/event/golden_test.go` accepted as the single source of truth.

**Python v0.3 scope**:
- Parity with Go v0.2: Bus (Publish/Subscribe/Invoke/StreamInvoke), in-memory + NATS transports, session context propagation.
- Middleware chain: Recover, Trace, Logging (Retry/DLQ deferred to v0.4).
- HTTP/SSE adapter parity optional (v0.4).

### v0.4 — Java SDK Evaluation
- Evaluate JVM ecosystem demand.
- If pursued, target Kotlin-first with Java interoperability, reusing the same schema and golden samples.

## 4. Runtime Layer: Reliability & Persistence

Goal: Move from "at-most-once" (NATS Core) to "at-least-once" with persistence, replay, and observability.

### v0.3 — JetStream Transport
- **Transport implementation**: `pkg/transport/jetstream/` with durable streams and consumer groups.
- **Delivery guarantee**: At-least-once for Pub/Sub; Invoke/Stream remain at-most-once (idempotency is caller responsibility).
- **Replay**: Time-based and sequence-based message replay for audit and debugging.
- **Pull Consumer**: Work-queue pattern for backpressure-sensitive consumers.

### v0.3 — DLQ & Retry Completion
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Exhausted retries automatically republished to `{prefix}.dlq.{event_type}` with full context.
- **Retry middleware**: Backoff policies (fixed, exponential, custom) with `acp.retry.attempt` metadata stamping.
- **JetStream ack/nack**: Integrate with middleware so retries use JetStream redelivery instead of in-process loops where possible.

### v0.4 — Observability Integration
- **Prometheus metrics**: Messages in/out, latency histograms, error rates per target.
- **Grafana dashboard templates**: Agent topology, throughput, latency percentiles.
- **Distributed tracing**: W3C Trace Context full support, OTel span linking across agent boundaries.

## 5. Control Plane: Agent Registry

Goal: Move from static configuration (hard-coded target names) to dynamic service discovery and governance.

### v0.4 — Registry Foundation
- **Agent Registry**: Central store of agent metadata (id, capabilities, version, health status).
- **Service Discovery**: `bus.Invoke` resolves target name to actual subject/endpoint via registry lookup.
- **Health Checks**: Heartbeat mechanism with automatic deregistration on timeout.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Route to specific agent instance based on tenant, load, or capability match.

### v1.0 — Enterprise Control Plane
- **Credential Distribution**: Per-agent TLS certificates or JWT signing keys issued by the control plane.
- **Rate Limiting & Quotas**: Per-tenant and per-agent request throttling.
- **Policy Engine**: Allow/deny lists for cross-agent invocation, audit logging.
- **Web Dashboard**: Visual topology map, real-time traffic flow, drill-down tracing.

---

## 6. Monitoring & Dashboard UI

Goal: Operational visibility into the agent mesh.

### v0.3 — Metrics & Logs
- Structured logging (`slog`) standardized across all packages.
- Prometheus exporter for key bus metrics.
- NATS monitoring integration (server stats, connection counts).

### v0.4 — Dashboard (Web UI)
- **Topology view**: Visual graph of agents, subjects, and invocation edges.
- **Live traffic**: Message rate, latency heatmap, error spikes.
- **Trace search**: Filter by TraceID, SessionID, or time range.
- **Agent management**: Register, deregister, update agent metadata via UI.

### v1.0 — Enterprise Observability
- **Alerting rules**: PagerDuty/Slack integration for agent health degradation.
- **Cost attribution**: Per-tenant message volume and latency attribution.
- **Historical analytics**: Trending, capacity planning, anomaly detection.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Breaking Change Policy
- **Schema version bump** (`SchemaVersion` field) for envelope structural changes.
- **Dual-write periods** for field migrations (e.g., `Phase` + `EventType` in v0.3).
- **Deprecation notices** logged at `Warn` level one minor version before removal.

### A2A Standard Tracking
- Monitor A2A spec releases quarterly.
- Maintain an "A2A compatibility scorecard" documenting gaps (tracked in `prompts/a2a_prot.md`).
- No commitment to full A2A alignment before v1.0; interoperability bridges are additive, not replacing native protocols.

### Python SDK Restart Gate
The Python SDK will not resume development until the three restart conditions in §3 are met. This is a hard gate to avoid chasing a moving Go API.
