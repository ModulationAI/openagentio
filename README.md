---

OpenAgentIO is a lightweight runtime bus for distributed AI agents.

It gives distributed agents one runtime API for invoke, streaming, pub/sub, async tasks, session propagation, and trace propagation, while allowing the underlying protocol model to evolve with open agent communication ideas.

OpenAgentIO is designed for conversational distributed systems: systems where agents, workers, tools, and runtimes exchange long-lived context across requests, streams, and events.

The project focuses on the runtime communication substrate beneath agent systems, rather than planning, workflows, RAG, prompt orchestration, or model-specific agent logic.


## Why OpenAgentIO?

Modern AI systems are no longer single agents running inside one process.

They are:
- distributed
- event-driven
- streaming-native
- cross-runtime
- multi-agent
- conversation-oriented

Yet most frameworks primarily focus on:
- prompting
- workflows
- tool calling

OpenAgentIO focuses on the runtime communication layer for AI agents and agent-adjacent workers.

It treats conversational context and lifecycle state as part of the runtime contract, not as application-level afterthoughts. Requests, streams, async task updates, and events stay connected through protocol-level context propagation and lifecycle semantics, while the concrete wire shape can evolve as OpenAgentIO absorbs stronger open-protocol ideas.

Designed for distributed runtime collaboration, OpenAgentIO enables agents, workers, and runtimes to communicate consistently across different transports, languages, and execution environments.

## OpenAgentIO is NOT another Agent Framework

Agent frameworks and OpenAgentIO solve different layers of the AI runtime stack.

| Agent Frameworks             | OpenAgentIO                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Workflow orchestration       | Runtime communication       |
| Prompt orchestration         | Runtime interoperability    |
| Tool execution               | Distributed messaging       |
| Single runtime coordination  | Cross-runtime collaboration |
| Agent logic                  | Agent networking            |
| Task pipelines               | Streaming communication     |
| In-process workflows         | Distributed runtime systems |


## Why Conversational Distributed Systems?

Message brokers move bytes between services. Agent systems need more than that.

In a conversational distributed system:
- a conversation may span multiple agents, services, tools, and runtimes
- a single user turn may produce request/reply calls, streaming deltas, pub/sub events, and async task updates
- nested agent calls need to preserve conversational, causal, and observability context
- streaming responses need a clear lifecycle: started, delta, final, or error
- transports should be replaceable without rewriting agent communication semantics

OpenAgentIO provides this layer as a small runtime bus: one message model, one bus API, and transport adapters underneath.

## Install

1. Go SDK (1.25+)
```sh
go get github.com/ModulationAI/openagentio
```

2. Python SDK (3.10+)
```sh
pip install openagentio
```

## Design Philosophy
OpenAgentIO focuses on the communication runtime layer for distributed AI agents.

Rather than building another agent framework, OpenAgentIO focuses on:
- invoke and request-reply semantics
- streaming agent communication
- async task signaling
- pub/sub patterns
- context propagation
- runtime interoperability
- transport-neutral messaging

The goal is to provide a small, explicit, and composable communication substrate for heterogeneous agent systems.

## Relationship to A2A

OpenAgentIO is not an alternative to A2A. A2A is an emerging interoperability protocol for agents;OpenAgentIO focuses on the runtime substrate that carries agent communication patterns inside distributed systems.
As the A2A ecosystem evolves, OpenAgentIO intends to absorb compatible ideas around:
   - task lifecycle semantics
   - streaming event models
   - interoperability patterns

while keeping the runtime model composable across different transport backends.sport-neutral.
